Here, we are going to introduce a little bit about python integrated with databases, including: Excel sheets

using pandas

    - treat Excel like a database
    - it can manipulate all the information in this sheets
    - the problem, ignore all graphs 

using Openpyxl

    - treat Excel like a sheet, including al sort of info
    - less efficient
    - keep the original structure

examples:
we have a table with sevices and products, according to gov taxes
- new tax multiplier: 50% of tax in products
